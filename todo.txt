TODO:

Account Page:
- Clicking account button shows user their account information
* Shows username, available funds, amount of purchases they've made
* Gives option for user to change password and add funds

CSS:
- Restyle CSS
* Restyle login/signup page css?
* Account tab CSS
* Sock browsing page CSS
* Buying page CSS
* CSS page resizing so labels look ok when page is small
* Responsive Design
* Animation for clicking dots to fade fitler bar in and out

Search Page:
- Live Search if I have time

Buy Page:
- If user has available funds, buy goes through. If not, error message saying user doesn't have enough funds. Purchase # increases if successful.
// to buy, i might need to make a submit button with an action that goes to a getFunds function which lets you buy if you have enough.

What I need help with from Cody:

- Display account information on account page
- Modify account information (Adding funds)

Current Errors:

- React minified error 105 when displaying accounts page and search page
- Currently get objects in database to display on search page with this error, but not info from accounts page
- Spam clicking on buy page makes it bug out (probably unfixable but will ask cody about!)
- Change password doesn't change password
